## Introduction
Fridge Raiders gives users the ability help minimize waste by keeping up with the expiration dates of all the items in their fridge. A user can initially populate their pantry through the **Add Items** feature. Once the user has populated their pantry for the first, they are able to continuously populate it through the **Grocery List** feature. As the user shops and checks off the items in their grocery list, those items will be relocated to the user's current pantry. As items expire in the pantry, the user is able to select between which items they'd like to relocate back to the grocery list and what items should be deleted. 

## Use Case
This application is intended to help users save money and leave a smaller waste footprint on Earth by reducing the amount of food they waste.
